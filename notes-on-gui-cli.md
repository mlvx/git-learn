# Notes on Git GUI and CLI

I have three ways to Git:
- Web (i.e., www.github.com);
- GUI (i.e., GitHub.exe);
- CLI (i.e., Git-PowerShell or Git-bash).

To that I should add a fourth way:
- SSH, or really, just bash.

That's enough for this.  I just want to see what happens when
the repo dir has a second file in it.  But this time I'll wait
a few seconds, so the .swp file goes away.  (Rats -- I'd meant
to start a new branch, so I could observe the merge again.  Oh
well, next time.)
